# tiny (0.3kB) redux- and redux-observable-like middleware for component-from-stream
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/component-from-stream-redux.png?compact=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/component-from-stream-redux/)

tiny (0.3kB gzip) [redux](https://npmjs.com/package/redux)- and
[redux-observable](https://npmjs.com/package/redux-observable)-like
middleware for [component-from-stream](https://npmjs.com/package/component-from-stream). <br/>
compatible with observable libraries such as [`RxJS`](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/)
or [`MOST`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/most).

# Example
see the full [example](./example/index.tsx) in this directory.
run the example in your browser locally with `npm run example`
or [online here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ZenyWay/component-from-stream-redux/v0.3.0/example/index.html).

```ts
// TODO

# <a name="API"></a>API
```ts
import { Subscribable } from 'rx-subject'
import { Reducer, Middleware } from "component-from-stream"
export { Subscribable, Reducer, Middleware }

export default function <S, A = {}>(
  reducer: Reducer<S, A>,
  ...effects: Effect<S, A>[]
): Middleware<S>

export declare type Effect<S, A> =
<E extends Subscribable<A>, Q extends Subscribable<S> = Subscribable<any>>(
  action$: E,
  state$?: Q
) => E

```

# `Symbol.observable`
This module expects `Symbol.observable` to be defined in the global scope.
Use a polyfill such as [`symbol-observable`](https://npmjs.com/package/symbol-observable/)
and if necessary a `Symbol` polyfill.
Check the [`symbol-observable-polyfill` script](./package.json#L10)
for an example of how to generate the standalone polyfill,
which can than be [loaded from a script tag](./example/index.html#L27),
or simply add `import 'symbol-observable'` at the top of your project's main file.

# TypeScript
although this library is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org),
it may also be imported into plain JavaScript code:
modern code editors will still benefit from the available type definition,
e.g. for helpful code completion.
