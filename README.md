# tiny (0.3kB) redux- and redux-observable-like operator for component-from-stream
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/component-from-stream-redux.png?compact=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/component-from-stream-redux/)

tiny (0.3kB gzip) [redux](https://npmjs.com/package/redux)- and
[redux-observable](https://npmjs.com/package/redux-observable)-like
operator for [component-from-stream](https://npmjs.com/package/component-from-stream). <br/>
compatible with observable libraries such as [`RxJS`](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/)
or [`MOST`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/most).

# Example
see the full [example](./example/index.tsx) in this directory.<br/>
run the example in your browser locally with `"npm run example"`
or [online here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ZenyWay/component-from-stream-redux/v0.5.1/example/index.html).

the [`component-from-stream` example](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/blob/master/docs/API.md#componentfromstream)
from [`recompose`](https://npmjs.com/package/recompose)
can be refactored to implement a redux-like setup as follows:

`counter/index.ts`
```ts
import redux from 'component-from-stream-redux'
import componentFromStream from '../component-from-stream'
import connect from '../connect'
import Counter from '../views/counter'
import reducer from './reducer'
import { createEventHandlers, createEventFactory } from '../event-handlers'
import { map, tap } from 'rxjs/operators'
import compose from 'basic-compose'
import log from '../console'

function mapStateToProps ({ props, count }) {
  return { ...props, count }
}

const mapDispatchToProps = createEventHandlers({
  onClickIncrement: 'CLICK_INCREMENT',
  onClickDecrement: 'CLICK_DECREMENT'
})

export default componentFromStream(
  Counter,
  createEventFactory('PROPS'),
  redux(reducer),
  () => tap(log('state:')),
  connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps),
  () => tap(log('view-props:'))
)
```

`counter/reducer.ts`
```ts
import { propCursor } from 'basic-cursors'
import { shallowEqual } from '../utils'

const inProps = propCursor('props')
const inCount = propCursor('count')

const reducers = {
  'PROPS': inProps(update()),
  'CLICK_INCREMENT': inCount(add(1)),
  'CLICK_DECREMENT': inCount(add(-1))
}

function update <S>(equal = shallowEqual) {
  return function (previous: S, current: S) {
    return equal(current, previous) ? previous : current
  }
}

function add (diff: number) {
  return function (previous: number) {
    return previous + diff
  }
}

export default function (state = { count: 0 }, event) {
  const { type, payload } = event
  const reducer = reducers[type]
  return !reducer ? state : reducer(state, payload)
}
```

note that instead of returning a new object with equal properties,
the reducer returns the original object.
in that case, the redux operator will not re-emit the previously emitted state,
which limits view rendering to only when state changes.

the `component-from-stream` factory is instantiated in a project's flavour,
i.e. rendering and observable frameworks,
from the higher-level factory exposed by the
[component-from-stream](https://npmjs.com/package/component-from-stream) module.
it may be instantiated and exposed by a central project-specific module:

`component-from-stream.ts`
```ts
import createComponentFromStreamFactory from 'component-from-stream'
import { Component } from 'inferno'
import { from } from 'rxjs'

export default createComponentFromStreamFactory(Component, from)
```

finally, the `component-from-stream-redux` module also exposes
a higher-level `connect` factory, very similar in purpose to
[its source of inspiration from the `react-redux` module](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options).
the higher-level factory returns a function which,
when composed as follows with a `map` operator yields
an operator for the `component-from-stream` factory.

as for the latter, a project-specific module may expose a corresponding shorthand:

`connect.ts`
```ts
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators'
import compose from 'basic-compose'

export default function <S={},P={}>(
  mapStateToProps: (state: S) => Partial<P>,
  mapDispatchToProps: (dispatch: (...args: any[]) => void) => Partial<P>
) {
  return compose.into(0)(map, connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps))
}
```
# <a name="API"></a>API
the [above example](#Example) provides a brief introduction
to the `redux` and `connect` functions exposed by this module.
however, both functions accept additional arguments,
as specified in the below type declarations:
* `redux` rest arguments are effects, similar to [`epics`](https://redux-observable.js.org/docs/basics/Epics.html),
their source of inspiration
from the [redux-observable](https://npmjs.com/package/redux-observable) module,
which transform the state and event streams into a stream of events
that is dispatched back into the reducer.
as for `epics`, events from the input event stream first hit the reducer
before the effects.
* `connect` accept an optional 3rd argument, that defines how to merge
the output of the `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` functions
into a new view props object.<br/>
when not specified, both outputs are shallow-merged:
`{ ...stateProps, ...dispatchProps }`
```ts
import { Subscribable } from 'rx-subject'
import { Reducer, OperatorFactory } from "component-from-stream"
export { Subscribable, Reducer }

export declare type Effect<S, A> = <
  E extends Subscribable<A> = Subscribable<A>,
  Q extends Subscribable<S> = Subscribable<S>
>(event$: E, state$?: Q) => E

export default function <
  S = {},
  A = {},
  Q extends Subscribable<S> = Subscribable<S>,
  E extends Subscribable<A> = Subscribable<A>
>(
  reducer: Reducer<S, A>,
  ...effects: Effect<S, A>[]
): OperatorFactory<A, A, S, E, Q>

export declare function connect<S = {}, P = {}>(
  mapStateToProps: (state: S) => Partial<P>,
  mapDispatchToProps: (dispatch: (...args: any[]) => void) => Partial<P>,
  mergeProps?: (stateProps: Partial<P>, dispatchProps: Partial<P>) => P
): ({ next }: StreamableDispatcher<any, any>) => (state: S) => P
```

# `Symbol.observable`
This module expects `Symbol.observable` to be defined in the global scope.
Use a polyfill such as [`symbol-observable`](https://npmjs.com/package/symbol-observable/)
and if necessary a `Symbol` polyfill.
Check the [`symbol-observable-polyfill` script](./package.json#L10)
for an example of how to generate the standalone polyfill,
which can than be [loaded from a script tag](./example/index.html#L27),
or simply add `import 'symbol-observable'` at the top of your project's main file.

# TypeScript
although this library is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org),
it may also be imported into plain JavaScript code:
modern code editors will still benefit from the available type definition,
e.g. for helpful code completion.
