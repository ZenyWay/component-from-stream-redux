# tiny (0.3kB) redux- and redux-observable-like operator factory for component-from-stream
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/component-from-stream-redux.png?compact=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/component-from-stream-redux/)

tiny (0.3kB gzip) [redux](https://npmjs.com/package/redux)- and
[redux-observable](https://npmjs.com/package/redux-observable)-like
operator factory for
[component-from-stream](https://npmjs.com/package/component-from-stream). <br/>
compatible with observable libraries such as [`RxJS`](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/)
or [`MOST`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/most).

# Example
see the full [example](./example/index.tsx) in this directory.<br/>
run the example in your browser locally with `"npm run example"`
or [online here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ZenyWay/component-from-stream-redux/v0.5.6/example/index.html).

the [example from the `component-from-stream` module](https://npmjs.com/package/component-from-stream) explores how to refactor
the [original `component-from-stream` example](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/blob/master/docs/API.md#componentfromstream)
from [`recompose`](https://npmjs.com/package/recompose)
to split view rendering from reactive operator behaviour.
although it is arguably overkill in this particular example,
it can nonetheless be further refactored to implement a redux-like setup
for the purpose of illustration.

components react to events which alter their internal state
and sometimes generate external side-effects.
a `redux`/`redux-observable` architecture is naturally well adapted
for implementing components with such behaviour,
and often brings a number of benefits,
among which simpler testing and maintainability.

## `counter/index.ts`
the main module of the `counter` component, which essentially wires it up.
```ts
import componentFromEvents, { redux, connect } from '../component-from-events'
import Counter from '../views/counter'
import reducer from './reducer'
import { createEventHandlers } from 'basic-fsa-factories'
import { tap } from 'rxjs/operators'
import log from '../console'

function mapStateToProps ({ props, count }) {
  return { ...props, count }
}

const mapDispatchToProps = createEventHandlers({
  onClickIncrement: 'CLICK_INCREMENT',
  onClickDecrement: 'CLICK_DECREMENT'
})

export default componentFromEvents(
  Counter, // stateless (pure) rendering function
  redux(reducer), // reduce events to component state
  () => tap(log('state:')),
  connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps), // map state to view props
  () => tap(log('view-props:'))
)
```
in addition to the `redux` higher-order operator factory,
the `component-from-stream-redux` module also exposes
a higher-order `connect` factory, very similar in purpose to
[its source of inspiration from the `react-redux` module](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options).
the higher-order factory returns a function which,
when composed with a `map` operator yields
an operator factory for the `component-from-stream` factory.<br/>
see the `component-from-events` module below for the corresponding shorthand
imported here.

## `counter/reducer.ts`
the reducer is the heart of the redux-based component:
it reacts to incoming events and reduces state accordingly.

the reducer is assembled from pure (stateless) functions in a functional way.
it is itself also a pure function,
and should typically be straightforward to test and maintain.
```ts
import { propCursor } from 'basic-cursors'
import { shallowEqual } from '../utils'

const inProps = propCursor('props')
const inCount = propCursor('count')

const reducers = {
  'PROPS': inProps(update()),
  'CLICK_INCREMENT': inCount(add(1)),
  'CLICK_DECREMENT': inCount(add(-1))
}

function update <S>(equal = shallowEqual) {
  return function (previous: S, current: S) {
    return equal(current, previous) ? previous : current
  }
}

function add (diff: number) {
  return function (previous: number) {
    return previous + diff
  }
}

export default function (state = { count: 0 }, event) {
  const { type, payload } = event
  const reducer = reducers[type]
  return !reducer ? state : reducer(state, payload)
}
```
note that when the state is not modified by an event,
the reducer returns the previous state object
instead of returning a new object representing the same state.
since the redux operator does not re-emit the previously emitted state,
the event is effectively ignored:
the view is only re-rendered when the state changes.

## `component-from-events.ts`
the `component-from-events` module exports generic project-level shorthands.

it exposes a shorthand of `component-from-stream`
with a built-in custom props dispatcher that dispatches `PROPS` events.
the main module of the `counter` component above imports this shorthand
as `componentFromEvents`.
```ts
import componentFromStream, { OperatorFactory, InfernoChildren } from './component-from-stream'
import { createActionFactory, StandardAction } from 'basic-fsa-factories'

export default function <Q = {}, P = any>(
  render: (props: Q) => InfernoChildren,
  factory: OperatorFactory<StandardAction<P>, any, any>,
  ...factories: OperatorFactory<StandardAction<P>, any, any>[]
) {
  return componentFromStream(
    render,
    createActionFactory('PROPS'), // custom `PROPS` event dispatcher
    factory,
    ...factories
  )
}
```
it also exposes a shorthand for `connect`,
which composes it with the `map` operator from [`RxJS`](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/):
```ts
import { connect as _connect } from 'component-from-stream-redux'
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators'
import compose from 'basic-compose'

export function connect <S={},P={}>(
  mapStateToProps: (state: S) => Partial<P>,
  mapDispatchToProps: (dispatch: (...args: any[]) => void) => Partial<P>
) {
  return compose.into(0)(map, _connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps))
}
```

# <a name="API"></a>API
the [above example](#Example) provides a brief introduction
to the `redux` and `connect` functions exposed by this module.
however, both functions accept additional arguments,
as specified in the below type declarations:
* `redux` rest arguments are effects, similar to [`epics`](https://redux-observable.js.org/docs/basics/Epics.html),
their source of inspiration
from the [redux-observable](https://npmjs.com/package/redux-observable) module.
effects transform the state and event streams into a stream of events
that is dispatched back into the reducer.
as with `epics`, events from the input event stream first hit the reducer
before the effects.
`epics` are typically meant to handle side-effects other than component state,
e.g. services such as persistence layers, remote APIs, timers, etc.
* `connect` accepts an optional 3rd argument, `mergeProps`, that defines how to
merge the output of the `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` functions
into a new view props object.<br/>
when not specified, both outputs are shallow-merged as follows:<br/>
`{ ...stateProps, ...dispatchProps }`
```ts
import { Subscribable } from 'rx-subject'
import { Reducer, OperatorFactory } from "component-from-stream"
export { Subscribable, Reducer }

export declare type Effect<S, A> = <
  E extends Subscribable<A> = Subscribable<A>,
  Q extends Subscribable<S> = Subscribable<S>
>(event$: E, state$?: Q) => E

export default function <
  S = {},
  A = {},
  Q extends Subscribable<S> = Subscribable<S>,
  E extends Subscribable<A> = Subscribable<A>
>(
  reducer: Reducer<S, A>,
  ...effects: Effect<S, A>[]
): OperatorFactory<A, A, S, E, Q>

export declare function connect<S = {}, P = {}>(
  mapStateToProps: (state: S) => Partial<P>,
  mapDispatchToProps: (dispatch: (...args: any[]) => void) => Partial<P>,
  mergeProps?: (stateProps: Partial<P>, dispatchProps: Partial<P>) => P
): ({ next }: StreamableDispatcher<any, any>) => (state: S) => P
```

# `Symbol.observable`
This module expects `Symbol.observable` to be defined in the global scope.
Use a polyfill such as [`symbol-observable`](https://npmjs.com/package/symbol-observable/)
and if necessary a `Symbol` polyfill.
Check the [`symbol-observable-polyfill` script](./package.json#L10)
for an example of how to generate the standalone polyfill,
which can than be [loaded from a script tag](./example/index.html#L27),
or simply add `import 'symbol-observable'` at the top of your project's main file.

# TypeScript
although this library is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org),
it may also be imported into plain JavaScript code:
modern code editors will still benefit from the available type definition,
e.g. for helpful code completion.
